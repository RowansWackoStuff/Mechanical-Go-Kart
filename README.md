# Mechanical-Go-Kart
This project is a mechanical go kart I spent the holidays builting from garage scraps and ordered parts.

My goal was to develop an offroad go kart I could take on my new years camping trip with my mates.

Goals:
- must fit in the boot of my car
- must be able to go at a fast speed (approximatly 20km/h)
- must have functional brakes and accelerator
- must support my body weight + weight of any friends who want to ride

Starting with a rough sketch i took inspiration for the old green machine vehicles with 2 levers used for steering on the side.
I chose this as at the time the go kart steering with spindles and tie rodes looked too complicated to me at the time so I chose to avoid them

With the sketch developed I refined a better sketch uusing solidworks developing a 3D model of the kart using an axle I purchased online as the reference for the width and height.

Developing the frame was done through deconstructing spare fence scraps we had lying around and cutting them into several beams.

These beams were assembled on the floor and welded together. (us very proud of our welding)

rear axle assembly:

The axle I used was from amazon a cheap rear axle that included the bearings, gear, brake disk and brakes.
The wheels were thick off road atv wheels with the correct dimensions for the rear hubs.

spindle version 1:
Whilst developing the kart I spent time looking into how other people had developed their go karts and after alot if research I released the steering system used for most the karts wasnt as complicated as I thought.
The website below shows a very straight forward way to make the steering spindles at home.

After attaching the wheels and the spindels to the kart I sat my fat ass on the kart and rolled for 5 meters before the spindles bent and permently disfigured...
