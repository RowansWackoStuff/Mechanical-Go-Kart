# Mechanical-Go-Kart
This project is a mechanical go-kart I spent the holidays building from garage scraps and ordered parts. My goal was to develop an offroad go-kart I could take on my New Year's camping trip with my mates.

Goals:
- must fit in the boot of my car
- must be able to go at a fast speed (approximately 20km/h)
- must have functional brakes and accelerator
- must support my body weight + the weight of any friends who want to ride
- Finished before new years trip

Starting with a rough sketch, I took inspiration from the old green machine vehicles with 2 levers used for steering on the side.
I chose this, as at the time the go kart steering with spindles and tie rodes looked too complicated to me at the time, so I chose to avoid them.

With the sketch developed, I refined a better sketch using SolidWorks, developing a 3D model of the kart using an axle I purchased online as the reference for the width and height.

## Frame

Developing the frame was done through deconstructing spare fence scraps we had lying around and cutting them into several beams.

</div>

These beams were assembled on the floor and welded together. (My mate and I very proud of our welding.)

## Rear axle assembly:

The axle I used was from Amazon a cheap rear axle that included the bearings, gear, brake disk and brakes.
The wheels were thick off-road ATV wheels with the correct dimensions for the rear hubs.

## Spindle Version 1:
Whilst developing the kart, I spent time looking into how other people had developed their go karts and after a lot of research, I realized the steering system used for most of the karts wasnt as complicated as I thought.
The website below shows a very straightforward way to make the steering spindles at home.

- Using a large fence post frame, the hinge was cut and drilled.
- Using an old pipe and bolt, the hinge now could rotate.

</div>

- Using an old trampoline leg (which just turned out to be the same diameter as the bearings on the Bunnings wheels I found), I attached the pipe to form the front axle.

- I cut straight pieces from this old moving dolly to add to the spindles for the steering plates.
<div><img src="Images/TrolleyPart.jpg " width="50%"/><img src="Images/allSpindleParts.jpg " width="50%"/></div>

- After all the parts were cut and assembled they were welded together to form the front steering spindles.

<div align="center"><img src="Images/KartPrototypeWheels.jpg " width="500" height="500"/> </div>
After attaching the wheels and the spindles to the kart, I sat my fat ass on the kart and rolled for 5 meters before the spindles bent and permanently disfigured...


## Spindle Version 2:
The goal for the second set of spindles was to make them as strong as possible. We went to Bunnings and used thick steel beams for the outer hinge, new steel pipe for the inner hinge and new bolts and steel for the axle and steering rod.

<div>

</div>

(This steel took upwards of 10 minutes to drill each hole... I recommend getting a better drill and drill bits than I had.)

</div>

</div>

Another issue with the previous spindles, was that during their short life span they would spin while the kart was moving. To solve this issue we added an additional straight support beam to stop rotation.

</div>

In addition to new spindles, we chose to swap the front wheels for the same wheels as the exterior, as they had better grip, with the downside of having to order new wheel hubs.
After a grueling 2-week wait the front wheel hubs arrived, and they could be attached to the bolts to form the front axles.

## Steering
The steering of the kart is done by twisting the spindles through a connecting beam. This beam rotates from the column of the cart. The screw holding it in place has to be loose in order for the steering beam to be able to go up and down. The steering wheel is a cut-off handle from a moving dolly.

## Brakes
The hydraulic brake was a pain, but after bleeding it worked perfectly. Pushing the pedal against the lever allows the fluid to compress the brake disk.

## Engine 1
The first engine attempt was a direct-driven mower engine. The engine didn't come with a sprocket, and no store sold one that fit the chain of the kart. To solve this, my dad and I attempted to sand cast a sprocket from aluminum.

Attempt 2:

</div>


After applying the sprocket, the engine had power but no clutch causing it to stall on every drive attempt.

</div>

## Engine 2
The second engine was a small 50cc engine with an internal clutch, allowing for the first successful drive. The problem was that this engine was too weak and struggled to go uphill (and the clutch stank up a storm).

## Engine 3
The final engine was a 210cc, 7hp, 4-stroke with an included clutch, sprocket, and chain. This engine worked like a charm, applying enough power to move (FAST) and the clutch operated perfectly for starting and stopping.

## Throttle 
The throttle is linked through a cable connecting the pedal and the engine throttle gauge. The engine spring allows the pedal to come back and forth when pressed.

# Conclusion
Goals:
- must fit in the boot of my car ✅
- must be able to go at a fast speed (approximately 20km/h) ✅
- must have functional brakes and accelerator ✅
- must support my body weight + the weight of any friends who want to ride ✅
- Finished before New Year's trip ❌
  
Unfortunately I was only able to complete the kart a week after I returned from my trip. 😢

# Next time:
- improved steering using tie rods
- thicker frame steel
- more secure spindle
