# Mechanical-Go-Kart
This project is a mechanical go kart I spent the holidays builting from garage scraps and ordered parts.

My goal was to develop an offroad go kart I could take on my new years camping trip with my mates.

Goals:
- must fit in the boot of my car
- must be able to go at a fast speed (approximatly 20km/h)
- must have functional brakes and accelerator
- must support my body weight + weight of any friends who want to ride

Starting with a rough sketch i took inspiration for the old green machine vehicles with 2 levers used for steering on the side.
I chose this as at the time the go kart steering with spindles and tie rodes looked too complicated to me at the time so I chose to avoid them

With the sketch developed I refined a better sketch using solidworks developing a 3D model of the kart using an axle I purchased online as the reference for the width and height.

## Frame

Developing the frame was done through deconstructing spare fence scraps we had lying around and cutting them into several beams.

These beams were assembled on the floor and welded together. (us very proud of our welding)

## Rear axle assembly:

The axle I used was from amazon a cheap rear axle that included the bearings, gear, brake disk and brakes.
The wheels were thick off road atv wheels with the correct dimensions for the rear hubs.

## spindle version 1:
Whilst developing the kart I spent time looking into how other people had developed their go karts and after alot if research I released the steering system used for most the karts wasnt as complicated as I thought.
The website below shows a very straight forward way to make the steering spindles at home.

Using a larged fence post frame the hinge was cut and drilled.

Using an old pipe and bolt the hinge now could rotate.

Using an old trampoline leg (which just turned out to be the same size diameter as the bearings on the bunnings wheels i found) I attached the pipe to form the front axle,

I cut straight peices from this old moving dolley to add to the spindles for the steering platees

After all the parts were cut and assemble they were welded together to form the front steering spindles.

After attaching the wheels and the spindels to the kart I sat my fat ass on the kart and rolled for 5 meters before the spindles bent and permently disfigured...


## spindle version 2:
The goal for the second set of spindels was to make them as strong as possible. We went to bunnings and used thick steel beams for the outer hinge, new steel pipe for the inner hinge and new bolts and steel for the axle and steering rod.

(This steel took upwards of 10 minutes to drill each hole... I recommend getting a better drill and drill bits than I had)

Another issue with the previous spindles was that during their short life spand they would spin while the kart was moving. To solve this issue we added an additional straight support beam to stop rotation.

In addition to new spindles we chose to swap the front wheels for the same wheels as the exterior as they had better grip with the downside of having to order new wheel hubs.
After a grooling 2 week wait the front wheel hubs arrived and they could be attached to the bolts to form the front axles.

With a new seat added the kart was starting to look more entertaining
